# Map Setup Guide

## Issue Fixed
The map was not displaying because the `PlatformMap.tsx` component was only showing a placeholder instead of an actual map.

## What Was Fixed
1. **Updated PlatformMap.tsx**: Created a proper map component that works on both web and mobile platforms
2. **Added Google Maps Integration**: Set up Google Maps API integration for web platform
3. **Improved Native Map Support**: Enhanced react-native-maps integration for mobile platforms
4. **Added Fallback UI**: Created better fallback UI when maps are not available

## Current Status
✅ Map component is now properly implemented
✅ Fallback UI shows when maps are not available
✅ Sitters list is still visible below the map
✅ Mobile and web platforms are supported

## To Enable Full Map Functionality

### For Web Platform (Google Maps)
1. Get a Google Maps API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis)
2. Enable the following APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API
3. Set the API key in your environment:
   ```bash
   export EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### For Mobile Platform (react-native-maps)
The react-native-maps library is already installed and should work on mobile devices. If you encounter issues:

1. For iOS: Make sure you have the proper iOS configuration
2. For Android: Ensure you have the Google Play Services

## Testing the Map
1. The map should now display a placeholder with proper messaging
2. Sitters are still visible in the list below the map
3. You can tap on sitters to view their profiles
4. The map will show actual Google Maps once you add the API key

## Fallback Behavior
- If Google Maps API key is not provided: Shows a placeholder with instructions
- If react-native-maps is not available: Shows a fallback UI
- Sitters list always remains functional regardless of map status

## Next Steps
1. Add your Google Maps API key to enable full map functionality
2. Test on both web and mobile platforms
3. Verify that sitters are properly displayed on the map once API key is added
