# Dual Network Setup - WiFi & Mobile Data Support

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Your pet-sitting app now supports both WiFi and mobile data connections with automatic IP detection and fallback.

## 🔧 What Was Updated

### 1. Network Configuration (`src/constants/config.ts`)
- **Primary IPs**: WiFi first (`192.168.100.192`), then mobile data (`172.20.10.2`)
- **Fallback IPs**: Multiple common network configurations for different scenarios
- **Dynamic Detection**: App automatically detects which network is working

### 2. Network Service (`src/services/networkService.ts`)
- **Smart Detection**: Tests IPs in priority order (WiFi → Mobile Data → Localhost)
- **Image URL Helper**: `getImageUrl()` function for dynamic image URLs
- **Fast Timeouts**: Optimized for mobile data (1-2 second timeouts)
- **Auto-Fallback**: Seamlessly switches between networks

### 3. Updated Screens (All hardcoded IPs replaced)
- `BookingScreen.tsx`
- `SitterProfilePopup.tsx` 
- `PetSitterProfileScreen.tsx`
- `ProfileScreen.tsx`
- `PetOwnerProfileScreen.tsx`
- `FindSitterMapScreen.tsx`
- `PaymentScreen.tsx`
- `PetSitterDashboard.tsx`
- `PetOwnerDashboard.tsx`
- `week-booking.tsx`
- `PhoneVerificationScreen.tsx`

## 🌐 How It Works

1. **WiFi Connection**: App tries `192.168.100.192:8000` first
2. **Mobile Data Fallback**: If WiFi fails, tries `172.20.10.2:8000`
3. **Automatic Switching**: No manual intervention needed
4. **Image Loading**: All images use dynamic URLs based on current network

## 🚀 Usage

### For WiFi Users:
- App automatically connects to your WiFi IP
- Fast, reliable connection

### For Mobile Data Users:
- App falls back to mobile data IP
- Seamless experience when switching networks

### For Development:
- Works with both networks simultaneously
- Easy to test different network scenarios

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify connectivity:
```bash
node test_dual_network.js
```

## 📱 Current Status

- ✅ WiFi IP: `192.168.100.192:8000` (Working)
- ✅ Mobile Data IP: `172.20.10.2:8000` (Configured)
- ✅ Localhost: `127.0.0.1:8000` (Working)
- ✅ Server: Running on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0:8000`)

## 🔄 Network Switching

The app will automatically:
1. Detect when you switch from WiFi to mobile data
2. Test the new network connection
3. Update all API calls and image URLs
4. Continue working seamlessly

## 🛠️ Server Configuration

Your Laravel server is now running with:
```bash
php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

This allows connections from:
- WiFi devices on your local network
- Mobile data devices (when configured)
- Localhost for development

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Seamless Experience**: Users can switch networks without app restart
2. **Reliability**: Automatic fallback ensures connectivity
3. **Development Friendly**: Easy to test different network scenarios
4. **Future Proof**: Easy to add more IP addresses as needed

Your app is now ready to work with both WiFi and mobile data connections! 🎉
