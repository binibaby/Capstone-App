## 🔄 Technical Details

### Data Structure
```typescript
// Recurring availability uses the same format as regular availability
{
  [date: string]: TimeRange[]
}

// Example:
{
  "2024-01-09": [{ startTime: "9:00 AM", endTime: "5:00 PM" }],
  "2024-01-16": [{ startTime: "9:00 AM", endTime: "5:00 PM" }],
  "2024-01-23": [{ startTime: "9:00 AM", endTime: "5:00 PM" }]
  // ... continues for 12 weeks
}
```

### Calendar Marking
```typescript
// Recurring dates are marked with purple color
markedDates[date] = {
  selected: true,
  marked: true,
  selectedColor: '#8B5CF6' // Purple for recurring
}
```

### State Management
```typescript
// New state for repeat weekly functionality
const [repeatWeekly, setRepeatWeekly] = useState(false);

// Helper function to check recurring status
const isRecurringAvailability = (date: string) => {
  return markedDates[date]?.selectedColor === '#8B5CF6';
};
```
