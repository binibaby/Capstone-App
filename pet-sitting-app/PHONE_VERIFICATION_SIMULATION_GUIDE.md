php test_api_phone_verification.php
```

### 2. Direct Controller Test
Run the controller test (may have header conflicts):
```bash
php test_phone_verification_simulation.php
```

### 3. Manual API Testing
```bash
# Send verification code
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/send-verification-code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone":"+639639283365"}'

# Verify code
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/verify-phone-code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone":"+639639283365","code":"472798"}'
```

## 📋 Log Monitoring

### View Enhanced Logs
```bash
# View all phone verification logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -E "(🔔|📱|✅|❌|🎭|⏰|🌐|👤|📞|🔍|🧹|🎉)"

# View only SMS simulation logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "📱 SMS"

# View verification process logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -E "(🔔|🎉)"
```

### Log Analysis Commands
```bash
# Count simulation events
grep -c "🎭" storage/logs/laravel.log

# Find successful verifications
grep -c "🎉 PHONE VERIFICATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY" storage/logs/laravel.log

# Find failed verifications
grep -c "❌ VERIFY SMS" storage/logs/laravel.log

# Get unique phone numbers tested
grep "📱 SEND SMS - Received phone verification request for:" storage/logs/laravel.log | cut -d' ' -f8 | sort | uniq
```

## 🚀 Enabling Real SMS

### 1. MessageBird Setup
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
MESSAGEBIRD_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
MESSAGEBIRD_ORIGINATOR=your_originator_here
```

### 2. Services Configuration
Add to `config/services.php`:
```php
'messagebird' => [
    'access_key' => env('MESSAGEBIRD_ACCESS_KEY'),
    'originator' => env('MESSAGEBIRD_ORIGINATOR'),
],
```

### 3. Install MessageBird SDK
```bash
composer require messagebird/php-rest-api
```

### 4. Add Funds
- Log into your MessageBird account
- Add funds to your wallet
- Verify your sender ID/originator

## 🔍 Debugging Features

### Cache Management
- Codes are stored in Laravel cache with 10-minute expiration
- Cache keys follow pattern: `phone_verification_{phone_number}`
- Cache is automatically cleared after successful verification

### Phone Number Formatting
The system automatically formats phone numbers:
- `09639283365` → `+639639283365`
- `9639283365` → `+639639283365`
- `+639639283365` → `+639639283365` (no change)

### Error Handling
- Fallback to simulation mode if MessageBird fails
- Detailed error logging with stack traces
- Graceful degradation for development

### Security Features
- 6-digit random verification codes
- 10-minute expiration time
- One-time use codes (cleared after verification)
- Input validation and sanitization

## 📊 Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Success Rate**: Successful verifications vs total attempts
2. **Response Time**: API response times
3. **Error Rate**: Failed verifications
4. **Simulation Usage**: How often simulation mode is used
5. **Cache Hit Rate**: Successful cache retrievals

### Log Analysis Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "📊 Phone Verification Analytics"
echo "=============================="
echo "Total SMS sent: $(grep -c '📱 SEND SMS' storage/logs/laravel.log)"
echo "Successful verifications: $(grep -c '🎉 PHONE VERIFICATION COMPLETED' storage/logs/laravel.log)"
echo "Failed verifications: $(grep -c '❌ VERIFY SMS' storage/logs/laravel.log)"
echo "Simulation mode usage: $(grep -c '🎭' storage/logs/laravel.log)"
echo "Unique phone numbers: $(grep '📱 SEND SMS - Received' storage/logs/laravel.log | cut -d' ' -f8 | sort | uniq | wc -l)"
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Development
1. Always use simulation mode during development
2. Monitor logs for debugging information
3. Test with various phone number formats
4. Verify cache expiration behavior

### Production
1. Configure MessageBird credentials properly
2. Monitor SMS costs and usage
3. Set up alerts for failed verifications
4. Regularly review logs for anomalies

### Testing
1. Test with valid and invalid codes
2. Test with expired codes
3. Test with different phone number formats
4. Test error scenarios and fallbacks

## 📝 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Headers already sent" error
- **Cause**: Output before header modification
- **Solution**: Use API endpoints instead of direct controller calls

#### 2. "Cache not found" errors
- **Cause**: Code expired or wrong phone number
- **Solution**: Check cache expiration and phone number format

#### 3. MessageBird errors
- **Cause**: Invalid credentials or insufficient funds
- **Solution**: Verify credentials and wallet balance

#### 4. API 404 errors
- **Cause**: Incorrect endpoint URLs
- **Solution**: Use correct endpoints: `/api/send-verification-code` and `/api/verify-phone-code`

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check if Laravel is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/test

# Check cache status
php artisan cache:clear

# View recent logs
tail -n 100 storage/logs/laravel.log

# Test phone formatting
php artisan tinker
>>> app('App\Http\Controllers\API\AuthController')->formatPhoneForSMS('09639283365')
```

## 🎉 Conclusion

The phone verification simulation system provides comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities for development and testing. The enhanced logging with emojis makes it easy to track the verification process and identify issues quickly.

For production use, simply configure MessageBird credentials and the system will automatically switch to real SMS delivery while maintaining all the logging features.
